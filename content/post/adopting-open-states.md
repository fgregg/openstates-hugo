As [Sunlight announced today](#TKTK), a group of Sunlight alumni are taking ownership of Open States with the goal of turning it into an independent, self-sustaining project.

We wanted to take some time today to explain who we are, what our plans are, and what we need from you if you want to see Open States succeed.

## Who We Are

As soon as Sunlight [announced](https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/09/21/whats-next-for-sunlight-labs/) that they'd be shutting down Sunlight Labs, people started getting in touch with me, asking what this meant for the future of Open States.

Everyone wanted to know one thing: would there be a way for this project
that was [community driven from day one](https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2009/02/26/fifty-state-project/), to continue without Sunlight's involvement?

**My immediate optimistic answer was "absolutely."**

After all, when we started the project we had no idea if Sunlight would want to continue it or if we'd ever find funding for it.

The project was built not just by Sunlight, but by a large community of contributors of code, support, and users contributing valuable feedback.
I have been encouraged that in recent weeks this same community has come forward with various offers of server space, financial support, and technical assistance.  It is great to see what the project means to people and that everyone agreed this resource should not fade away.
As we began to process these generous offers of help we started processing what it would take to run the project without the institutional support of Sunlight.

**The sober truth is that it won't be easy.**

The project typically had 3 full time developers dedicating at least part of their week to it.
That core team of Paul Tagliamonte, Rachel Shorey, and Miles Watkins left Sunlight in 2015 and for the last year the project has had a barebones staff, it has been kept afloat mainly by the valiant efforts of Andy Lo and those saintly volunteer contributors that have always made the project possible.

I'm glad to say that despite knowing the challenges ahead, we are prepared to ensure that the important resource lives on.  I've talked with Miles, Rachel, Paul, Andy, and a great set volunteers, and all have made it known they are ready to step forward to ensure that we'll have an Open States in 2017 and beyond.

## What We Need

Today we're also asking for your help.  The two things we need the most: money and volunteers.

First we're establishing a general support fund to support the core infrastructure of the project.  100% of the money raised by this effort will go to project expenses.  Because we know you're taking a leap of faith in donating, we pledge to publicly account for every dollar we spend from these donations.  We expect the bulk of the initial donations to be earmarked for server costs.

If you're an individual that would like to donate to this general support fund: **Please Donate Today**.

If you're interested in making a larger donation, or funding a specific piece of development such as a feature or state, please [get in touch with us](mailto:funding@openstates.org).

Second, we're looking for people that are experienced with web scraping and/or Python that are willing to help us update and (in the future) maintain state scrapers.  We've set up a [volunteer survey](#TKTK) to help us keep track of these kinds of offers.  Please fill it out and we'll be in touch ASAP.

## What's next?

Our immediate plan is to stand up an essentially static version of OpenStates.org.  We've spent some late nights preparing so that there will be little to no interruption to the most used portions of the site.  This will ensure both that the countless applications depending on Open States' API do not break overnight and that the historical reference material collected on OpenStates.org (in quite a few cases reaching further back than state's own sites) doesn't vanish.

We will not be scraping the remainder of the year, most states are not in session and we felt that this compromise was the best way to ensure our focus could be on stability and preparing for the coming year.

Once we are confident in the stability of the static site, we aim to start bringing scrapers back online ASAP.  Unfortunately, given the relatively short timeframe we're looking at, we can't yet make any promises about specific timeframes.  We're beginning to look at options to incentivize developers to maintain states, and of course, volunteers will make up an enormous amount of the effort.
