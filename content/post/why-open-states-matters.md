Earlier this week we [announced](/post/adopting-open-states/) that Open States is now maintained by the community of Sunlight Foundation alumni and volunteers that created the project.

We expect that getting Open States fully operational again will take a significant effort, and we know from experience that maintaining the many scrapers isn't easy either.  

_Of course that's part of why we're looking for [volunteers](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMDjoVoKxSOciIiqE3Ofxgn-caFGCxicFO2LwyWAK8zdXyhg/viewform) and [donations](https://generosity.com/fundraisers/open-states-general-support-fund)._

We thought it might be worth explaining why, despite the challenges, we are undertaking this new effort.  In short, why we think Open States matters.

## Open States So Far

Over seven years ago, Sunlight Labs [announced](https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2009/02/26/fifty-state-project/) what we then called the Fifty State Project, an effort to provide the public with information on America's state legislatures.

The goal was ambitious, to replicate the service provided by sites like [GovTrack](https://govtrack.us/) for every state legislature in the country, aggregating and structuring data on [over 7,000 elected officials](http://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/number-of-legislators-and-length-of-terms.aspx) and the tens of thousands of bills that they brought to the floor each year.

It was only with the full support of the Sunlight Foundation, its funders, and code contributions from dozens of friends in the civic tech community that we were able to accomplish that goal.

Over the last six years, the project grew beyond anything we'd imagined.

A few highlights:

* More than 75 [contributors](https://github.com/openstates/openstates/graphs/contributors) stepped forward to help us make the project what it is today.
* In 2013 [we launched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHKbMg1tPsg) our full website, a place for people to track legislators and legislation in their states.
* The API grew to be Sunlight's most popular data resource, with millions of requests each month.
* The project inspired several other amazing projects like [OpenElections](http://openelections.net/faq/) that tapped into the potential of the larger civic tech community to come together to achieve otherwise impossible goals.
* We saw the creation of Open States-powered tools like [MinnPost's Legislature Tracker](http://code.minnpost.com/legislature-tracker/), an Open Source tool that built on Open States to allow news organizations to build custom bill trackers.  That tool was adopted in at least four other states.
* A team at UChicago's Data Science for Social Good program built the [Legislative Influence Detector](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/lid/), finding where model bills written by lobbying organizations find their way into actual legislation and law.

These last two points in particular highlight the potential transformative power of Open States.  While there paid services exist that provide some of the same data as Open States, they are expensive and geared primarily at web use.  Open States is unique in that it is open data, freely available, and extensible by the community.

While [OpenStates.org](http://openstates.org) is a valuable resource for individuals, the real power of Open States is that it has always been a data-first project.  All Open States data is available via the API and bulk downloads, so that researchers, journalists, and activists can build on the platform.

## The Future of Open States

Our [first post](/post/adopting-open-states/) details our immediate plans to repair & rebuild Open States in coming months.  We're doing this not only because we're hopeful to continue providing the same Open States that people have been using for four years, but because there is a lot more we'd like to do with Open States in the future.

We plan to double down on making the data as accessible and useful as possible, introducing a new more powerful API based on the [Open Civic Data](https://opencivicdata.org) platform.  Beyond that we hope to find opportunities to collaborate more with journalists and other users with specific needs to fill gaps in the available information and provide easier to use tools.

We'd love to hear from those of you that are interested in using state legislative data in new and interesting ways.  If you're considering a new project using Open States or want to make us aware of your current project, please [get in touch](mailto:contact@openstates.org).

And of course, please consider [signing up as a potential volunteer](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMDjoVoKxSOciIiqE3Ofxgn-caFGCxicFO2LwyWAK8zdXyhg/viewform) or [making a small donation](https://generosity.com/fundraisers/open-states-general-support-fund).
