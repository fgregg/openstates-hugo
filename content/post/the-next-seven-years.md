### Where we came from

Seven years ago, [Sunlight Labs announced The Fifty State Project](https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2009/02/26/fifty-state-project/), an effort to provide the public with information on America's state legislatures.

The goal was ambitious, to replicate [Open Congress](http://www.opencongress.org/) for every state legislature in the country, aggregating and structuring data on [over 7,000 elected officials](http://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/number-of-legislators-and-length-of-terms.aspx) and the tens of thousands of bills that they brought to the floor each year. But with the full support of the Sunlight Foundation and its funders, and code contributions from dozens of friends in the civic tech community, we were able to accomplish that goal. In 2010, data for several states was first made available for use via our API, and in 2013 [we launched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHKbMg1tPsg) our full website, including all fifty states, plus DC and Puerto Rico.

From then on, the project was known as Open States.

### Where we are

- see what kat's post looks like before writing this

### Where we're going

- we’re in the process of forming an organization to try to ensure Open States is sustainable

- we want to keep the site up while we pay down some technical debt, so it is going into a read-only mode for a few months

- any money we collect will go towards costs, we may raise money again in the future for other needs but that’s what we’re asking for today
