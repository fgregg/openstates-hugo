## Where we came from

Over seven years ago, Sunlight Labs [announced](https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2009/02/26/fifty-state-project/) the Fifty State Project, an effort to provide the public with information on America's state legislatures.

The goal was ambitious, to replicate the service provided by sites like [GovTrack](https://govtrack.us/) for every state legislature in the country, aggregating and structuring data on [over 7,000 elected officials](http://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/number-of-legislators-and-length-of-terms.aspx) and the tens of thousands of bills that they brought to the floor each year.  It was only with the full support of the Sunlight Foundation, its funders, and code contributions from dozens of friends in the civic tech community that we were able to accomplish that goal. 

In 2010, data for several states was first made available for use via our API. 

Over the following six years, the project grew beyond anything we'd initially imagined, a few highlights:
    * More than 75 [contributors](https://github.com/openstates/openstates/graphs/contributors) stepped forward to help us build the project to what it is today.
    * In 2013 [we launched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHKbMg1tPsg) our full website, a place for people to track legislators and legislation in their states.
    * The API grew to be Sunlight's most popular resource, with tens of millions of requests each year.
    * The project inspired several other amazing projects that tapped into the potential of the civic tech community to come together to achieve otherwise impossible goals.
